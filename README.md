# Predicting Revenue for Apprentice Chef

## Overview

This project focuses on developing various linear regression models to predict the revenue generated by Apprentice Chef, a gourmet meal delivery service. The dataset, extracted from an Excel file, undergoes thorough exploration and transformation to enhance the accuracy of the predictive models.

## Initial Data Exploration

- **Histogram Analysis:** The distribution of the target variable, REVENUE, is explored through histograms. Recognizing the positive skewness, a logarithmic version of REVENUE is introduced to normalize the distribution.

## Variable Selection

- **Correlation Analysis:** The correlation between potential features and REVENUE is evaluated. Variables like AVG_TIME_PER_SITE_VISIT, TOTAL_MEALS_ORDERED, and TOTAL_PHOTOS_VIEWED exhibit significant correlations.

- **Feature Engineering:** The creation of new features, such as 'AVG_MEALS,' enhances the predictive power of the model. This new feature captures information about customers with a preference for unique meals relative to the total number of meals ordered.

## Model Development and Evaluation

- **Model Candidates:** Different linear regression models, including Lasso, ARD, Unpruned/Pruned Regression Trees, Unpruned/Pruned Random Forest, and Unpruned Gradient Boosted Machines (GBM), are considered.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The REVENUE variable and TOTAL_MEALS_ORDERED are transformed logarithmically for model development. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the models.

- **Model Performance:** Models are trained and tested using a 75:25 train-test split. The unpruned GBM emerges as the best-performing model, achieving a test score of 0.8139.

## Conclusion

The unpruned GBM model, with a small train-test gap (0.0463), demonstrates robust performance in predicting the revenue generated by Apprentice Chef. This model, built on thorough data exploration, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning, allows for accurate predictions and generalizes well to new, unseen data. The insights derived from this model can empower Apprentice Chef in making informed, data-driven decisions for business growth.
